# Romanian Programmers Keyboard Layout for macOS

This macOS keyboard layout has popped up on the internet before, and I have changed it's definition to fit under Romanian and created an iconset with a Romanian flag, so it looks in line with the other options. 

Romanian - Programmers allows easy input of Romanian diacritics using the `alt` key:

* `alt+a` -> `ă`
* `alt+q` -> `â`
* `alt+i` -> `î`
* `alt+s` -> `ș`
* `alt+t` -> `ț`

## Installation

To install this keyboard layout you need to move the `Romanian - Programmers.bundle` file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calini/romanian-programmers-macos.git /tmp/romanian-programmers-macos && sudo cp -r /tmp/romanian-programmers-macos/Romanian\ -\ Programmers.bundle /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
```

## Screenshots

It shows up under the Romanian section, like the default ones.
